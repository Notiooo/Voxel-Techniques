<p align="center">It is a voxel engine with an emphasis on fast and optimised terrain rendering. For now that's it ðŸ˜Š</p>

## About the project
The project focuses on comparing multiple techniques for optimising voxel worlds therefore it will include many different approaches and benchmarks. A side effect of this should be a quite optimised world generator and good performance in terms of rendering this world.
